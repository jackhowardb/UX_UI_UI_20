          An unexpected search for care can be confusing anxiety provoking endevor. AccessCare is a mobile application that overcomes the barriers to ideal patient care. The experience offers people to book the closest providers in network of the user's insurance. The other features of the application provide quicker and more effienct results than its competitors.<br> My Role:<br>UX Researcher, Competitive Analysis, Ideation, Information Architecture, Usability testing and analysis.<br>Project Time:<br>7 days

          <p class="card-text">
            The quest of the research project is to help someone who needs to find a provider as soon as possible preferably one that is in their insurance plan. The large and well established healthcare industry can be complex at times. <br><br>The eluciation of pain points and problems (pie charts on the left) from user research using one to one interviews and a survey  when they were asked what they experieced in searching for providers when in need of one. These were key insights in developing an application that can be quicker and more efficient than our competitors.<br><br>

          <p class="card-text">
            In the search for a possible solution to help the user I performed one to one interviews and created a survey. I compared five similar mobile applications of thier features as well as a hueristic evaluation of the applications.<br><br>The results of the research concluded that an application with features not found in most competitors applications such as checking in to the clinic online might speed up the process of seeing a provider for ideal patient care.

          <h5 class="card-title">Definition</h5>
          <p class="card-text">
            A way to help explain how the application would work would be through a story board. The user is able to search for a provider that can use the user's location and upload thier insurance to find the closest provider with availability to be seen the same day.<br> This will potentially decrease the use of emergency rooms and emergent care clinics as well as the user's anxiety and frustration.

            The value proposition statement of AccessCare is quicker, closer and the right care.<br><br> The mobile application has the potential to make more efficient use of time due to the features for the user. The application can also save money by decreasing visits to emergency rooms and emergent care centers.

          <h5 class="card-title">Prototype</h5>
          <p class="card-text">
            The process of the prototype had many iterations.<br><br> I performed the usability testing and analysis during this project. The results of the usability testing showed that iteration of the "Home" button, improvement of white space as well as font and aligment issues were the top priority.<br><br>After the iterations were performed in two rounds the application was "easy to use", "liked that it showed distance", and overall most testers said "it felt good to use."
